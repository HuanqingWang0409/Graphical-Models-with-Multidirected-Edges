# Learning Linear Non Gaussian Graphical Models with Multidirected Edges
▪	Proposed a recursive backtracking algorithm in **machine learning** to learn graphical models with multidirected edges.
▪	Implemented the algorithm using **Python** and **R** in the recovery of **1774 out of 3600** graphs.<br />
▪	Collaborating with researchers in other fields, used the algorithm to examine the relationships between land productivity and plant diversity and discovered three multidirected edges not found before.<br />
▪	Wrote a package for the proposed algorithm and published a paper in the **Journal of Causal Inference**. Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05306 (names are in alphabetical order)

# Learning Linear Non Gaussian Graphical Models with Multidirected Edges
▪	Proposed a recursive backtracking algorithm to learn the graphical model with multidirected edges.<br />
▪	Implemented the algorithm using Python and R in the recovery of 1774 out of 3600 graphs.<br />
▪	Collaborating with researchers in other fields, used the algorithm to examine the relationships between land productivity and plant diversity and discovered three multidirected edges not found before.<br />
▪	Completed an R package and published a paper on the Journal of Causal Inference. Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05306
